== Introduction

Whenever is a Ruby gem that provides a clear syntax for defining cron jobs. It outputs valid cron syntax and can even write your crontab file for you. It is designed to work well with Rails applications and can be deployed with Capistrano. Whenever works fine independently as well.

Ryan Bates created a great Railscast about Whenever: http://railscasts.com/episodes/164-cron-in-ruby

Discussion: http://groups.google.com/group/whenever-gem

== Installation
  
$ sudo gem install whenever

== Getting started

  $ cd /my/rails/app
  $ wheneverize .

This will create an initial "config/schedule.rb" file you.

== Example schedule.rb file
  
  every 3.hours do
    runner "MyModel.some_process"       
    rake "my:rake:task"                 
    command "/usr/bin/my_great_command"
  end

  every 1.day, :at => '4:30 am' do 
    runner "MyModel.task_to_run_at_four_thirty_in_the_morning"
  end

  every :hour do # Many shortcuts available: :hour, :day, :month, :year, :reboot
    runner "SomeModel.ladeeda"
  end

  every :sunday, :at => '12pm' do # Use any day of the week or :weekend, :weekday 
    runner "Task.do_something_great"
  end

== Define your own job types

Whenever ships with three pre-defined job types: command, runner, and rake. You can define your own with <code>job_type</code>.

For example:

  job_type :awesome, '/usr/local/bin/awesome :task :fun_level'
  
  every 2.hours do
    awesome "party", :fun_level => "extreme"
  end
  
Would run <code>/usr/local/bin/awesome party extreme</code> every two hours. <code>:task</code> is always replaced with the first argument, and any additional <code>:whatevers</code> are replaced with the options passed in or by variables that have been defined with <code>set</code>.

The default job types that ship with Whenever are defined like so:

  job_type :command, ":task"
  job_type :runner,  "cd :path && script/runner -e :environment ':task'"
  job_type :rake,    "cd :path && RAILS_ENV=:environment /usr/bin/env rake :task"

If a <code>:path</code> is not set it will default to the directory in which <code>whenever</code> was executed. <code>:environment</code> will default to 'production'.

== Cron output

  $ cd /my/rails/app
  $ whenever

And you'll see your schedule.rb converted to cron sytax. Note: running `whenever' with no options does not display your current crontab file, it simply shows you the output of converting your schedule.rb file.

== Capistrano integration

In your "config/deploy.rb" file do something like:

  after "deploy:symlink", "deploy:update_crontab"

  namespace :deploy do
    desc "Update the crontab file"
    task :update_crontab, :roles => :db do
      run "cd #{release_path} && whenever --update-crontab #{application}"
    end
  end

This will update your crontab file, leaving any existing entries unharmed. When using the <code>--update-crontab</code> option, Whenever will only update the entries in your crontab file related to the current schedule.rb file. You can replace the <code>#{application}</code> with any identifying string you'd like. You can have any number of apps deploy to the same crontab file peacefully given they each use a different identifier.

If you wish to simply overwrite your crontab file each time you deploy, use the <code>--write-crontab</code> option. This is ideal if you are only working with one app and every crontab entry is contained in a single schedule.rb file.

By mixing and matching the <code>--load-file</code> and <code>--user</code> options with your various :roles in Capistrano it is entirely possible to deploy different crontab schedules under different users to all your various servers. Get creative!

If you want to override a variable (like your environment) at the time of deployment you can do so with the <code>--set</code> option: http://wiki.github.com/javan/whenever/setting-variables-on-the-fly

Whenever was created for use at Inkling (http://inklingmarkets.com) where I work. Their take on it: http://blog.inklingmarkets.com/2009/02/whenever-easy-way-to-do-cron-jobs-from.html

While building Whenever, I learned a lot by digging through the source code of Capistrano - http://github.com/jamis/capistrano
